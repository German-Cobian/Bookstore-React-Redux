# Bookstore-React-Redux

A React-Redux app that allows for the user to input a book with the information on title, author, and  category, posting it to an API ( https://us-central1-bookstore-api-e63c8.cloudfunctions.net/bookstoreApi).

![Input book](/src/assets/Input-book.png?raw=true "Input book")

It then fetches and displays info on books all contained in that API. The user can also remove an existing book and its associated info from the list.
